## A Framework for Describing Human-AI Reasoning Processes

---

## The Problem: A Vocabulary Crisis

When we use large language models to do serious work, we default to two metaphors—and both are wrong.

**"Collaboration"** implies shared intention. AI has no intention.

**"Tool use"** implies a passive instrument. Tools don't have a latent structure you can probe.

**"AI-assisted"** implies the human writes and AI assists. The actual process is more integrated than that.

We lack language to describe the high-bandwidth interface between human reasoning and computational systems. This document proposes a precise alternative.

## The Definition

### Generative Productive Dialogue (GPD)

**A reasoning process between a human chain of thought and a computational latent structure, conducted through iterative exchange, that generates artifacts—text, images, analysis, documents—as output.**
