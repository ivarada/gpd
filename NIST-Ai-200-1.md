### Overview and Purpose
This publication provides a framework to classify how artificial intelligence (AI) systems contribute to outcomes within human-AI interactions (HAII). The primary aim of the AI Use Taxonomy is to classify AI implementations into a structure that can aid in the **measurement and evaluation** of AI systems. The taxonomy emphasizes human goals and outcomes and is intended to foster positive, human-centered interactions with AI systems.

### Key Features and Structure
*   **16 AI Use Activities:** The taxonomy identifies **16 AI use "activities"** that define the function an AI system plays in achieving an outcome. Tasks are understood as combinations of one or more of these activities.
*   **Technique- and Domain-Independence:** A core feature of the taxonomy is that these activities are independent of the specific AI techniques used (e.g., neural networks, reinforcement learning) and the application domains (e.g., finance, medicine, law). This independence ensures the taxonomy remains robust despite rapid technological advancements.
*   **Focus on Outcome:** The taxonomy focuses on the **outcome or results** of a user’s interaction with an AI system, rather than how the user interaction is executed.

### Applications and Benefits
The AI Use Taxonomy is intended for use by AI actors involved in various stages of the AI lifecycle, including design, development, deployment, test, evaluation, verification and validation (TEVV), and governance.

The taxonomy contributes to the understanding and evaluation of AI systems in several ways, including:
*   Providing **common terminology** for describing outcome-based human-AI activities.
*   Highlighting commonalities in ** measurement and evaluation needs** across disparate AI techniques.
*   Facilitating the evaluation of **trustworthiness characteristics and usability** of AI systems.
*   Enabling **cross-domain insights** based on shared human-AI activities.

### The 16 AI use activities are:

1.  **Content creation**
    generating new artifacts such as video, narrative, software code, synthetic data.
2.  **Content synthesis**
    combining and/or summarizing parts, elements, or concepts into a coherent whole.
3.  **Decision making**
    selecting a course of action from among possible alternatives in order to arrive at a solution.
4.  **Detection**
    identifying, by careful search, examination, or probing, the existence or presence of [something].
5.  **Digital assistance**
    acting as a personal agent for understanding and responding to commands and questions, and carrying out requested tasks in a conversational manner.
6.  **Discovery**
    finding, recognizing, or unearthing something for the first time.
7.  **Image analysis**
    recognizing attributes within digital images to extract meaningful information.
8.  **Information retrieval/search**
    finding information about specific topics of interest.
9.  **Monitoring**
    observing, checking, and watching over the process, quality, or state of [something] over time to gain insights into how [something] is behaving or performing.
10. **Performance improvement**
    improving quality and efficiency of the intended outcomes.
11. **Personalization**
    designing and tailoring [something] to meet an individual's characteristics, preferences, or behaviors.
12. **Prediction**
    forecasting the likelihood of a future outcome.
13. **Process automation**
    performing repetitive tasks, removing bottlenecks, reducing errors and loss of data, and increasing efficiency of a process.
14. **Recommendation**
    suggesting or proposing a manageable set of viable options to aid decision-making.
15. **Robotic automation**
    using physical machines to automate, improve, and/or optimize a variety of tasks.
16. **Vehicular automation**
    automating physical transportation of goods, instrumentation and/or people.
